# This is just an example, you can add whatever you want, 
# but it must be in yaml format, these values can be accessed
# in the test case through the self.testbed.get() method.
example:
  key1: value1
  key2: 
    key2-1: value2-1
    key2-2: value2-2
  key3:
    - value3-1
    - value3-2
    - value3-3
